## üìñ What I learned

<br />

It was good to see how a more real world based project should be, for sure it was a great opportunity to improve my skills with css, using flexbox and grid to compose complex layouts, and using react, next and some npm packages to handle interactivity and logic in a more in depth way.

This project was my most recent attempt of next 13, and it was a game changer for me, to understand how next works towards production and the new gimmicks of this version (13).

Lastly I want to add that this project helped me to evaluate more precisely the time I take to build a project and manage it all the way down to production and in what point I am in web development.
